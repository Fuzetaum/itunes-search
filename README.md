This project is a simple search page for an artist's albums by name. It uses the iTunes search API underneath.

To run it, you need to have installed Node.js and Yarn in your computer. Then, via CLI, navigate to the project's folder, and run `yarn` to install all dependencies.

After that, running `yarn start` will start local development server and will automatically open the portal on your browser.

To build the website to be hosted, run `yarn build` after installing all dependencies. It will generate a `build` folder with all files to be hosted.
